My second devchallenges challenge in the "Responsive Web Developer"-path: Building a page for a team.

The challenge:
Create a "My team"-page following the design. The page should be responsive.

User story:
The page is following the give design.

**Experience:** <br>

- After my last devchallenge, I decided to focus on getting the media queries right, especially focusing on working with media queries more efficiently (meaning, not having to rewrite all components for every breakpoint, just the components and the properties that are affected).

- It took a while to figure out how I could solve the rotate text. My main struggles were: 1. How to rotate the text, 2. how to place it within the "card", and 3. How to make the rotated text stay in the same place even at larger brakpoints.
